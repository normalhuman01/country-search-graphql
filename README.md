# Country Search React App

This is a simple web application for searching countries based on GraphQL. It was created as a non-profit project inspired by [Kimche's Challenge](https://github.com/normalhuman01).

## Description

The Country Search React App allows users to search for countries using a GraphQL API provided by [this GraphQL endpoint](https://countries.trevorblades.com/). It is built using various libraries and tools, including:

- React
- Styled components for styling
- Apollo Client for handling GraphQL queries
- Lodash for utility functions
- Conventional commits for version control commits
- Commitlint for commit message linting
- Eslint with the Airbnb configuration for code linting
- Husky for pre-commit and pre-push hooks

## Usage

You can use the following scripts to work with the project:

- `yarn start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will automatically reload when you make edits, and lint errors will be displayed in the console.

- `yarn test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more information.

- `yarn build`: Builds the app for production, creating an optimized version in the `build` folder. The production build is minified and includes hashed filenames, making it ready for deployment.

- `yarn eject`: This is a one-way operation that should be used with caution. It removes the build tool's single dependency from your project and provides full control over configuration files and dependencies. You can customize the build configuration as needed.
